Recently, there has been a surge of unauthorized login attempts, and you suspect that a seasoned black-hat hacker is behind them. This hacker has shown proficiency in SQL Injection and appears to be using the 'UNION' SQL keyword to trick the login process into returning additional data. However, your application's security measures include filtering special characters in user inputs, a method usually effective against such attacks.

Given 'p=150' and 'q=200', the security level is deemed to be sufficient for current threats. The system can handle a decryption process with a time complexity of O(n^1.5) without compromising performance. However, an attacker using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer could potentially crack RSA with a time complexity of O(log n)^3.

Your server, reinforced with advanced security measures, can handle 'h' packets per second before it starts showing signs of strain. If 'r' surpasses 'h', it overwhelms the server, causing it to become unresponsive.
